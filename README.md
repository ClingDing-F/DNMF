Discriminative Non-negative Matrix Factorization

This method is used for the binary and multi-classification problem on images, which can preserve the original data distribution in the subspace.

This code is a reproduce code from the original paper [Discriminative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for dimensionality reduction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231215012886)
